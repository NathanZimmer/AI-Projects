# AI-Projects
This is a compilation of projects that I created for my Artificial Intelligence class. I had to design each of these algorithms using lectures from my professor and pseudocode posted on the class website. 

These projects include:
- nearest neighbor algorithm for evaluating loan applicants
- nearest neighbor algorithm for text detection in images
- min-max function for game playing
